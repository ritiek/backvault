# 🗄️ BackVault

**BackVault** is a lightweight Dockerized service that periodically backs up your **Bitwarden** or **Vaultwarden** vaults into password-protected encrypted files.  
It’s designed for hands-free, secure, and automated backups using the official Bitwarden CLI.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔒 Securely exports your vault using your Bitwarden credentials  
- 🕐 Supports both **interval-based** and **cron-based** backup scheduling  
- 💾 Password-protected backup files using AES encryption  
- 🌐 Works with both Bitwarden Cloud and self-hosted Vaultwarden (supports self-signed certs)  
- 🐳 Runs fully containerized — no setup or local dependencies required

---

## 📦 Quick Start (Docker)

You can run BackVault directly using the **published Docker image**, no build required.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name backvault \
  -e BW_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id" \
  -e BW_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret" \
  -e BW_PASSWORD="your_master_password" \
  -e BW_SERVER="https://vault.yourdomain.com" \
  -e BW_FILE_PASSWORD="backup_encryption_password" \
  -e BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS=12 \
  -v /path/to/backup:/app/backups \
  ghcr.io/mvfc/backvault:latest
````

> 🔑 **Important**: The container uses the official Bitwarden CLI internally.
> Your credentials are only used to generate the export — they are **never stored** persistently.

---

## 🧩 Docker Compose Example

Here’s how to set it up with Docker Compose for easy management:

```yaml
services:
  backvault:
    image: ghcr.io/mvfc/backvault:latest
    container_name: backvault
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      BW_CLIENT_ID: "your_client_id"
      BW_CLIENT_SECRET: "your_client_secret"
      BW_PASSWORD: "your_master_password"
      BW_SERVER: "https://vault.yourdomain.com"
      BW_FILE_PASSWORD: "backup_encryption_password"
      BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS: 12
      NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED: 0
    volumes:
      - ./backups:/app/backups
```

Then run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

BackVault will automatically:

1. Log in to your Bitwarden/Vaultwarden instance
2. Export your vault
3. Encrypt it using `BW_FILE_PASSWORD`
4. Store the backup in `/app/backups` (mounted to your host directory)
5. Logout after every backup

## 🔐 Restore & Decrypting Backups

Bitwarden encrypted exports use the **same key derivation and encryption** methods as Bitwarden itself — not generic AES or OpenSSL.
This means you **must use the Bitwarden CLI** to decrypt or restore the backups.

### 🪄 How to restore a backup

1. Install the official **Bitwarden CLI**:
   [https://bitwarden.com/help/cli/](https://bitwarden.com/help/cli/)

2. Run the following command to import (decrypt) your backup:

   ```bash
   bw import --format encrypted_json --password <BACKUP_PASSWORD> --file /path/to/backup.json
   ```

   Replace `<BACKUP_PASSWORD>` with the same value used for `BW_FILE_PASSWORD` when the backup was created.

3. You can import into:

   * The **same** account you exported from, or
   * A **different** Bitwarden account (the encryption is self-contained).

4. The vault contents will be decrypted and restored automatically.

---

### 🔍 Why `openssl` or manual decryption doesn’t work

When you export with:

```bash
bw export --format encrypted_json --password <PASSWORD>
```

Bitwarden:

1. Salts and stretches your password using your account’s KDF settings (PBKDF2 or Argon2).
2. Derives a new key via HKDF.
3. Encrypts your vault data with AES-CBC and adds a Message Authentication Code (MAC).

The resulting file is a **Bitwarden-encrypted export**, not a generic AES file.
Only the Bitwarden CLI can correctly handle this format.

---

## 🧠 Tips

* Use a dedicated Bitwarden service account for backups.
* Store `BW_FILE_PASSWORD` securely — it’s required for restoring backups.
* You can run this container alongside Vaultwarden on the same host or a separate machine.
* Combine with tools like `restic` or `rclone` to push backups to cloud storage.
