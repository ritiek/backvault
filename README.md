# 🗄️ BackVault

**BackVault** is a lightweight Dockerized service that periodically backs up your **Bitwarden** or **Vaultwarden** vaults into password-protected encrypted files.
It’s designed for hands-free, secure, and automated backups using the official Bitwarden CLI.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🔒 Securely exports your vault using your Bitwarden credentials
* 🕐 Supports both **interval-based** and **cron-based** backup scheduling
* 💾 Password-protected backup files using AES encryption
* 🧹 **Automated Cleanup**: Automatically deletes old backups based on a configurable retention period.
* ✨ **Two Encryption Modes**: Choose between Bitwarden's native encrypted format or a portable, standard AES-256-GCM encrypted format.
* 🌐 Works with both Bitwarden Cloud and self-hosted Bitwarden/Vaultwarden
* 🐳 Runs fully containerized — no setup or local dependencies required

---

## 📦 Quick Start (Docker)

You can run BackVault directly using the **published Docker image**, no build required.
You can use either the GitHub Registry image (`ghcr.io/mvfc/backvault`) or the Docker Hub image (`mvflc/backvault`).

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name backvault \
  -e BW_SERVER="https://vault.yourdomain.com" \
  -e BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_MODE="raw" \
  -e BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS=12 \
  -v /path/to/backup:/app/backups \
  -v /path/to/db:/app/db \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  ghcr.io/mvfc/backvault:latest
```

> 🔑 **Important**: The container uses the official Bitwarden CLI internally.
> Your credentials are only used to generate the export — they are **never stored** persistently and **never sent** anywhere else.

---

## 🧰 Initial Setup Flow

BackVault now includes a **secure one-time web-based setup UI** that replaces the need to pass sensitive credentials via environment variables.
When you start the container for the first time, it will:

1. Detect that no secure configuration exists yet.
2. Launch a **local-only setup UI** (FastAPI) on port `8080`.
3. Prompt you to enter your Bitwarden credentials and backup password.
4. Encrypt and store them in an **SQLCipher-encrypted SQLite database**, using a generated pragma key.
5. Securely store the encryption key and database inside the container volume, accessible only to the container’s internal user.

Once setup is complete:

* The UI **automatically shuts down**.
* The container transitions into normal mode and begins scheduled backups.
* All sensitive data is encrypted at rest — no plaintext secrets remain.

You can safely restart or update the container later without re-entering credentials, as long as the `/app/db` volume persists.

> 🧩 **Tip:** You can mount the `/app/db` directory to your host if you want to persist encrypted credentials across container updates.

---

## 🛡️ Security Architecture

The new version of BackVault is built around **principle of least privilege** and **container-isolated secrets**:

* 🧱 **Non-root container:** The service runs under an unprivileged user (`UID 1000`).
* 🔐 **Encrypted credential store:** All secrets (Bitwarden credentials, file encryption key and master password) are stored in an SQLCipher database using AES-256 encryption.
* 🔄 **No plaintext environment secrets:** You no longer need to define sensitive values like `BW_PASSWORD` or `BW_CLIENT_SECRET` as environment variables.
* 🕶️ **Ephemeral setup interface:** The setup UI is automatically destroyed after configuration to minimize attack surface and idle resource usage.

Together, these changes make BackVault one of the most secure self-hosted Bitwarden backup utilities available — suitable even for multi-user and shared-host environments.

## 🧩 Docker Compose Example

Here’s how to set it up with Docker Compose for easy management:

```yaml
services:
  backvault:
    image: ghcr.io/mvfc/backvault:latest
    container_name: backvault
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      BW_SERVER: "https://vault.yourdomain.com"
      BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_MODE: "raw" # Use 'bitwarden' for the default format
      BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS: 12
      NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED: 0
    volumes:
      - ./backups:/app/backups
      - ./db:/app/db
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

Then run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

BackVault will automatically:

1. Log in to your Bitwarden/Vaultwarden instance
2. Export your vault
3. Encrypt it using the chosen file password
4. Store the backup in `/app/backups` (mounted to your host directory)
5. Logout after every backup

## 🔐 Decrypting Backups

BackVault supports two encryption modes, set by the `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_MODE` environment variable. The decryption method depends on which mode was used to create the backup.

### Mode 1: `bitwarden` (Default)

This mode uses Bitwarden's native encrypted JSON format. It's secure but proprietary, meaning you **must use the Bitwarden CLI** to decrypt it.

**How to Decrypt:**

1.  Install the official **Bitwarden CLI**: bitwarden.com/help/cli/
2.  Config the CLI to point to your server with `bw config server`.
3.  Log in using `bw login`.
4.  Run the `import` command. This will decrypt the file and import it into your vault.

    ```bash
    # This command decrypts the file and imports it into a vault.
    bw import bitwardenjson /path/to/backup.enc
    ```

    You will be prompted to enter your encryption password before the import can complete.

> This method can be used to restore your vault into the same or a different Bitwarden account. The encryption is self-contained.

### Mode 2: `raw` (Recommended for Portability)

This mode exports the vault as raw JSON and then encrypts it in-memory using a standard, portable format: **AES-256-GCM** with a key derived using **PBKDF2-SHA256**.

The main advantage is that you **do not need the Bitwarden CLI** to decrypt your data, making it ideal for disaster recovery. You can use standard tools like Python or OpenSSL.

**File Structure:**
The resulting `.enc` file contains: `[16-byte salt][12-byte nonce][encrypted data + 16-byte auth tag]`

**How to Decrypt (Python Script):**

Here is a simple Python script to decrypt the file. You only need the `cryptography` library.

1.  Save the code below as `decrypt.py`.
2.  Install the dependency: `pip install cryptography`.
3.  Run the script: `python decrypt.py /path/to/backup.enc "YOUR_FILE_PASSWORD"`

```python
# decrypt.py
import os
import sys
from getpass import getpass
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2 import PBKDF2HMAC
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.exceptions import InvalidTag

SALT_SIZE = 16
KEY_SIZE = 32
PBKDF2_ITERATIONS = 600000

def decrypt_data(encrypted_data: bytes, password: str) -> bytes:
    salt = encrypted_data[:SALT_SIZE]
    nonce = encrypted_data[SALT_SIZE:SALT_SIZE+12]
    ciphertext_with_tag = encrypted_data[SALT_SIZE+12:]

    kdf = PBKDF2HMAC(algorithm=hashes.SHA256(), length=KEY_SIZE, salt=salt, iterations=PBKDF2_ITERATIONS)
    key = kdf.derive(password.encode("utf-8"))

    aesgcm = AESGCM(key)
    return aesgcm.decrypt(nonce, ciphertext_with_tag, None)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print(f"Usage: python {sys.argv[0]} <encrypted_file> [password]")
        sys.exit(1)

    file_path = sys.argv[1]
    password = sys.argv[2] if len(sys.argv) > 2 else getpass("Enter backup password: ")

    try:
        with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
            encrypted_contents = f.read()
        
        decrypted_json = decrypt_data(encrypted_contents, password)
        print(decrypted_json.decode("utf-8"))
        print("\nDecryption successful.", file=sys.stderr)
    except InvalidTag:
        print("Decryption failed: Invalid password or corrupted file.", file=sys.stderr)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
```

## 🧠 Tips

* Store your backup file password securely — it’s required for restoring backups.
* You can run this container alongside Vaultwarden on the same host or a separate machine.
* Combine with tools like `restic` or `rclone` to push backups to cloud storage.
